## Motivation

This project aims to answer questions as such,

1. How many projects are in the Cosmos and Tendermint ecosystem?
2. Which projects are using which technology?

~~This repository will be the singular source of truth for the Cosmos & Tendermint projects. Therefore, this repository should be considered as a living document which will be maintained by the community. This repository is not limited to the ecosystem listed on [Cosmos Network - Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/ecosystem).~~ So long as you're using Cosmos / Tendermint, you can add your project ~~to the `JSON` [file](/data/posts-manifest.js). ðŸŒŒ~~ using this [Airtable form](https://airtable.com/shrHJJ4U4ChUxjILk).
